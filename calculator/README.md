# Calculator (learning project)

A tiny console calculator used as a learning exercise in C# and .NET.

What it is
- Simple arithmetic operations implemented in a console app. Intended for practice with input/output and basic program flow.

Prerequisites
- .NET 9 SDK installed. Check with `dotnet --version`.

Build & run
From the repository root you can build the project or run it directly:

```bash
dotnet build calculator
dotnet run --project calculator
```

Notes
- This is a learning example not production-ready. Feel free to add small improvements (error handling, unit tests, more operations).
